The mixture of white rum, mint, lime juice, sugar and soda water is crisp and clean with a relatively low alcohol content, the soda water can be replaced with sprite or 7-up. When preparing a mojito always crush the mint leaves as opposed to dicing to unlock oils that will assist with enhancing the minty flavour.',

The keys to the preparation of a Cosmopolitan are a good brand of cranberry juice and Cointreau Triple Sec, two essential elements to the drink.',

The cocktail reflects this with the various spirits used within the cocktail from all over the world. A mixture of run, vodka, tequila and gin finished with orange liqueur, lemon juice and orange juice to mask the various spirits used throughout. Strong and yet sweet. The cocktail is finished with either a slice of orange or a twisted peel of orange rind.',
